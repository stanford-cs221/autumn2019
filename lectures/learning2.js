  'First, we discussed some general principles for designing good features for linear predictors.',
  'Just with the machinery of linear prediction, we were able to obtain rich predictors which were quite rich.',

  'Second, we focused on expanding the expressivity of our predictors fixing a particular feature extractor $\\phi$.',

  'We covered three algorithms: <b>linear predictors</b> combine the features linearly (which is rather weak), but is easy and fast.',
  //'Note that we can always make the hypothesis class arbitrarily large by adding more features, but that\'s another issue.',
  _,
  '<b>Neural networks</b> effectively learn non-linear features, which are then used in a linear way.',
  'This is what gives them their power and prediction speed, but they are harder to learn (due to the non-convexity of the objective function).',
  _,
  '<b>Nearest neighbors</b> is based on computing similarities with training examples.',
  'They are powerful and easy to learn, but are slow to use for prediction because they involve enumerating (or looking up points in) the training data.',
